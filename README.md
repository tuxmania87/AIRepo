## Portfolio from Robert Hartmann

Hello  
I am working in a BI environment and handle data every day. Prepared at university I handled the tasks and challenges at work with little effort and could dive deep into data analysis and understanding. During my path I have mastered SQL and hence am able to do data analysis quickly and efficiently.  

I want to steer my career now even deeper into data analysis which brings me to the field of Data Science.  
Merging this interest with my university degree (M.Sc.) motivates me to even handle the most different challenges that await me there.

On this github repository I will publish data science projects that I use to practice and improve my skill set.
